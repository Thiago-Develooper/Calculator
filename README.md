# Calculator
calculator made using JavaScript and Bootstrap, it was made with the help of the "Complete Web Development" course by udemy, the bootstrap already came ready, leaving for me to apply the logic of the calculator in the web environment, during the project I refactored the code a few times to leave it more comprehensive, clean and logical.
